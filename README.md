Loan Prediction ML Project

This project uses Machine Learning to predict loan approvals based on applicant data. The model uses logistic regression and can be extended with other algorithms.

Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Scikit-learn – machine learning models

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Optional) – data visualization

Features

Predicts loan approval (Loan_Status) based on:

Gender

Marital Status

Applicant's Income

Co-applicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit History

Property Area

And more…

Handles missing values

Encodes categorical variables

Scales features for better model performance

Evaluates model using accuracy score
