# Loan Prediction ML Project

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict loan approvals based on applicant data.  
The model uses **Logistic Regression** and can be extended with other ML algorithms.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (Optional)** – Data visualization

## Features
- Predicts **loan approval** (`Loan_Status`) based on:
  - Gender  
  - Marital Status  
  - Applicant's Income  
  - Co-applicant Income  
  - Loan Amount  
  - Loan Term  
  - Credit History  
  - Property Area  
  - And more…

- Handles missing values automatically  
- Encodes categorical variables  
- Scales features for better model performance  
- Evaluates model using **accuracy score**
